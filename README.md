# Kmer_genotyping
We were unable to relly on SNPs to learn the parents of our progeny. We are trying again with KMERs now. KMERs offer a non refrence based method of doing this analysis which may be part of the problem of using SNPs.
TO make Kmers run the Merge_Kmer_making_x.sh files. Then you can filter KMERS following the Kmer_Filter_Sapelo2.sh file. Although the R steps do not work in sapelo2. Every other part does though.
